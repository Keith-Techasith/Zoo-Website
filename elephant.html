        <p> The Asian elephant, also known as the Asiatic elephant, is the only living species of the genus Elephas and
            is distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India in the west, Nepal in the
            north, Sumatra in the south, and to Borneo in the east.
            Three subspecies are recognised—E. m. maximus from Sri Lanka, E. m. indicus from mainland Asia and E. m.
            sumatranus from the island of Sumatra.
            Formerly, there was also the Syrian elephant or Western Asiatic elephant which was the westernmost
            population of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).</p>

        <p>The Asian elephant is the largest living land animal in Asia. 
            Since 1986, the Asian elephant has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as the population has declined by at least 50 percent over the last three elephant generations, which is about 60–75 years. 
            It is primarily threatened by loss of habitat, habitat degradation, fragmentation and poaching. 
            In 2019, the wild population was estimated at 48,323–51,680 individuals.
            Female captive elephants have lived beyond 60 years when kept in semi-natural surroundings, such as forest camps.</p>
