    <p>Odontodactylus scyllarus, commonly known as the peacock mantis shrimp, harlequin mantis shrimp, painted mantis shrimp, 
        clown mantis shrimp or rainbow mantis shrimp, is a large stomatopod native to the epipelagic seabed across the Indo-Pacific, ranging from Guam to East Africa, and as far South as Northern KwaZulu Natal in South Africa.
        In the marine aquarium trade, it is both prized for its attractiveness and considered by others to be a dangerous pest.

    <p>
        Peacock mantis shrimp mostly live in shallow parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The crustacean spends much of its time looking for crabs and mollusks to eat. 
        When it finds a delicious-looking snack, the animal goes into full-on boxer mode. Springing out one of its club-like front claws, the animal delivers a swift punch to its prey. 
        The punch is 50 times faster than the blink of an eye and strong enough to break glass!
        These shrimp also rely on their sparing moves to keep enemies away from burrows in the ocean floor that they use as shelters.
        Hovering at the opening of its burrow, a peacock mantis shrimp will strike at intruders that come too close.
