            The polar bear is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle,
            encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses.
            It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore.

        <p>Most adult female grizzlies weigh 130–180 kg (290–400 lb), while adult males weigh on average 180–360 kg (400–790 lb). 
            Average total length in this subspecies is between 198 cm (78 in) and 240 cm (94 in),[19] with an average shoulder height of 102 cm (40 in) and hindfoot length of 28 cm (11 in).
            Newborn bears may weigh less than 500 g (18 oz). In the Yukon River area, mature female grizzlies can weigh as little as 100 kg (220 lb). 
            For a female, these average weights would be 136 kg (300 lb) inland and 227 kg (500 lb) coastal, respectively.
