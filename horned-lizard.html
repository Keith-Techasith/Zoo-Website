    <p>Horned lizards (Phrynosoma), also known as horny toads or horntoads, are a genus of North American lizards and the type genus of the family Phrynosomatidae. 
        The common names refer directly to their horns or to their flattened, rounded bodies, and blunt snouts.

        The generic name Phrynosoma means "toad-bodied". In common with true toads (amphibians of the family Bufonidae), horned lizards tend to move sluggishly, 
        often remain motionless, and rely on their remarkable camouflage to avoid detection by predators. They are adapted to arid or semiarid areas. 
        The spines on the lizard's back and sides are modified reptile scales, which prevent water loss through the skin, whereas the horns on the head are true horns (i.e., they have a bony core). 
        Of the 21 species of horned lizards, 15 are native to the USA. The  largest-bodied and most widely distributed of the American species is the Texas horned lizard.

        Horned lizards use a variety of means to avoid predation. Their coloration generally serves as camouflage. When threatened, their first defense is to remain still to avoid detection. 
        If approached too closely, they generally run in short bursts and stop abruptly to confuse the predator's visual acuity. 
        If this fails, they puff up their bodies to cause them to appear more horned and larger, so that they are more difficult to swallow.

        At least eight species (P. asio, P. cornutum, P. coronatum, P. ditmarsi, P. hernandesi, P. orbiculare, P. solare, and P. taurus) are also able to squirt an aimed stream of blood from the corners of the eyes for a distance up to 5 ft (1.5 m).
        They do this by restricting the blood flow leaving the head, thereby increasing blood pressure and rupturing tiny vessels around the eyelids. The blood not only confuses predators, but also tastes foul to canine and feline predators. It appears to have no effect against predatory birds. 
        Only three closely related species (P. mcallii, P. modestum, and P. platyrhinos) are certainly known to be unable to squirt blood.

        While previous thought held that compounds were added to the blood from glands in the ocular sinus cavity, current research has shown that the chemical compounds that make up the defense are already in the circulating blood. 
        It is possible that their diet of large quantities of venomous harvester ants could be a factor; however, the origin and structure of the chemicals responsible are still unknown. 
        The blood-squirting mechanism increases survival after contact with canine predators;[4] the trait may provide an evolutionary advantage. 
        Ocular autohemorrhaging has also been documented in other lizards,[6] which suggests blood-squirting could have evolved from a less extreme defense in the ancestral branch of the genus. 
        Recent phylogenic research supports this claim, so the species incapable of squirting blood apparently have lost the adaptation for reasons yet unstudied.
